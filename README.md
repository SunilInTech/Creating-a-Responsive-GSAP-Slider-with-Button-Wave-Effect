We'll dive into the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code required to build this interactive slider, and discuss the key concepts and techniques used to achieve this effect.

In this tutorial, we've created a responsive GSAP slider with a button wave effect. We've used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing slider that navigates through three sections with different backgrounds and fruit images. The slider also has a wave effect on the navigation buttons, adding an extra layer of interaction.
